# Settings

Everything is set in `.env` (copy `.env.example`). Only the first three are required.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | | **Required**, 16+ characters. Shared secret Immich sends with every event. |
| `HANDOFF_STORE_KEY` | | **Required** for joining and offering services from the page, 16+ characters. Encrypts the saved API keys. Keep a copy: without it they cannot be read. `HANDOFF_STORE_KEY_FILE` reads it from a Docker secret file instead. |
| `IMMICH_NETWORK` | `immich_default` | Docker network Immich runs on (used by `docker-compose.yml`). |
| `IMMICH_BASE_URL` | `http://immich-server:2283` | Address of Immich as seen from this container. |
| `PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL` | `http://immich-handoff:8080/webhook/immich` | Address the Immich **server** uses to reach this app (not your browser). |
| `PUBLIC_IMMICH_URL` | | Address of Immich as your browser sees it; switches on thumbnails of waiting photos. |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Where the saved memberships live (the `handoff-data` volume). |
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | `:8080` | Where the app listens inside the container. |
| `NOTIFY_URL` | | ntfy-style URL that receives a message when something needs attention. |
| `SWEEP_INTERVAL_HOURS` | `24` | How often the safety-net check runs. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug` also logs incoming events. |
| `DRY_RUN` | `false` | Log what would happen and change nothing. |

## Fixed accounts only

These apply to services you define yourself ([Fixed accounts](fixed-accounts.md)). Services people create on the page choose their own inbox tag and expiry in the form, and each sender chooses move or copy.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `IMMICH_SOURCE_API_KEYS` | | API keys of the sending accounts, comma separated. |
| `IMMICH_DEST_API_KEY` | | API key of the receiving account. |
| `ROUTES_FILE` | | Path of a routes file for several services. |
| `ALLOW_JOIN` | `false` | Let people join the single service from the page. |
| `SHARE_TAG` | `share` | Tag people add to send a photo. |
| `INBOX_TAG` | `inbox` | Tag on new photos in the receiving account. Services created on the page add `/<name>` to it. |
| `INBOX_EXPIRY_DAYS` | `30` | Days before an unfiled photo loses the inbox tag. |
| `REFUSED_TAG` | `share-duplicate` | Tag put on an original that could not be handed over. |
| `SENT_TAG` | `handed-over` | Copy mode: tag put on an original after it was copied. |
| `HANDOFF_MODE` | `copy` | `copy` keeps the senders' originals; `move` sends them to the sender's trash. |
| `DELETE_FORCE` | `false` | `true` deletes moved originals permanently instead of trashing them. |
